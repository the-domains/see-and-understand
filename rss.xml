            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Simple & Clear MLB Pay</h1><p>There's something about a DNA Chart, especially when the data passes from positive, through zero to negative.

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Complex Map with a Clear Picture</h1><p>I love how the detail and you could say complexity of this map actually makes the difficulties found in the region so much more clear. Had the map been simplified to a country level Â you'd see what we already know...countries have borders and they battle with each other.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/aa821613b1ad8aa48198bedafa6eaae69d89a126.png"></article>]]></description>
