There's something about a DNA Chart, especially when the data passes from positive, through zero to negative. It's delightfully clear not just who the top and bottom players are but also grabs your attention at how they compare with the overall average, something that a standard bar chart with an average reference line would struggle to do.

The only improvement I would suggest is to make the blue circles a little smaller than the red and place the red on top of the blue. As it is it's difficult to take your eye off the blue and focus on the red which is the main subject.
